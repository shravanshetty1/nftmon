# NFTMON


## Scope
```
Router Protocol

You are building a decentralized application that allows users to create and transfer unique
digital assets. Each asset is represented by a non-fungible token (NFT) that is stored in a
smart contract called the NFT contract.
The NFT should have at least one characteristic called score. Others characteristics can be
added if required. The score characteristic should be updated on the basis of the following
points.
1. The score will be zero when the NFT will be minted.
2. Every time the NFT is transferred, it will evolve. Thus the score will be updated.
a. NFT level will increase by x for each transfer
b. X will be dependent on -
i. The last action timestamp.
ii. If transferred to a new address

Your task is to implement the NFT contract in CosmWasm and to define the necessary
storage. The NFT contract should expose the required Read/ Write methods.
